		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I am currently a full time student attending UVIC for computer science. My programming hobby started out when I was 12, when I took a summer course on making websites with HTML. I have since learned php, python, javscript, and Java. I've dabbled a bit in using swift. Currently I am focusing on the web developpement aspect of computer science, but hopefully one day I will build applications.</p>
